        Get a number from Scanner and create an Array according to the entered number
        The first part of the Array should be given numbers from 0 up to half of the entered
        number
        The second half of the Array should be -1 ( the rest of the indices)
        Finally, print the entire array

        How to print;
        One time with for loop
               - the print should be like  (0,1,2,3,4,-1.-1) and there should be a (,) between
               numbers.
               - note, there should not be (,) after the last element.
        Second time with Arrays.toString
        if you cannot to any part of the task, complete the rest of them.
