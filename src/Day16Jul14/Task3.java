3- print the largest String:
Get 10 Strings from the user and save them in an array. (with scanner.Next()). then iterator through the array and find the largest String. (you can check a String's length with someString.length()). then print the largest String.
hint: While you are iterating the array, you should keep both "size of largest String" and "index of largest String".
